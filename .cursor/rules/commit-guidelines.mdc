# Commit and Pull Request Guidelines

## Commit Messages
- Use **imperative mood** (e.g., "add", "update", "fix")
- Keep messages concise but descriptive
- Expand short messages to specify what changed (e.g., "feat: add rust tooling")
- Use lowercase for simple updates, expand for significant changes

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Reference related issues in PR body
- Describe user-visible effects clearly
- Mention any follow-up tasks needed
- Include reproduction or validation steps
- Note plugin migrations or breaking changes
- Attach screenshots for visual changes

## Validation Steps
Include these commands in PR descriptions:
- `nvim --headless "+Lazy sync" +qa` - Plugin installation test
- `nvim --headless -c "checkhealth" -c "qa"` - Health check validation
- Manual testing steps for new features
- Keymap conflict verification

## Security Considerations
- Never commit machine-specific secrets
- Use local environment variables for API tokens
- Document any required environment setup
- Avoid hardcoded paths or personal information
